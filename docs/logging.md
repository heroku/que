## Logging

By default, Que_0_14_3 logs important information in JSON to either Rails' logger (when running in a Rails web process) or STDOUT (when running via the `que` executable). So, your logs will look something like:

```
I, [2014-01-12T05:07:31.094201 #4687]  INFO -- : {"lib":"que","thread":104928,"event":"job_worked","elapsed":0.01045,"job":{"priority":"1","run_at":"2014-01-12 05:07:31.081877+00","job_id":"4","job_class":"MyJob","args":[],"error_count":"0"}}
```

Of course you can have it log wherever you like:

```ruby
Que_0_14_3.logger = Logger.new(...)
```

You can use Que_0_14_3's logger in your jobs anywhere you like:

```ruby
class MyJob
  def run
    Que_0_14_3.log :my_output => "my string"
  end
end

#=> I, [2014-01-12T05:13:11.006776 #4914]  INFO -- : {"lib":"que","thread":24960,"my_output":"my string"}
```

Que_0_14_3 will always add a 'lib' key, so you can easily filter its output from that of other sources, and the object_id of the thread that emitted the log, so you can follow the actions of a particular worker if you wish. You can also pass a :level key to set the level of the output:

```ruby
Que_0_14_3.log :level => :debug, :my_output => 'my string'
#=> D, [2014-01-12T05:16:15.221941 #5088] DEBUG -- : {"lib":"que","thread":24960,"my_output":"my string"}
```

If you don't like JSON, you can also customize the format of the logging output by passing a callable object (such as a proc) to Que_0_14_3.log_formatter=. The proc should take a hash (the keys are symbols) and return a string. The keys and values are just as you would expect from the JSON output:

```ruby
Que_0_14_3.log_formatter = proc do |data|
  "Thread number #{data[:thread]} experienced a #{data[:event]}"
end
```

If the log formatter returns nil or false, a nothing will be logged at all. You could use this to narrow down what you want to emit, for example:

```ruby
Que_0_14_3.log_formatter = proc do |data|
  if [:job_worked, :job_unavailable].include?(data[:event])
    JSON.dump(data)
  end
end
```
